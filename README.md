# About

This is an tool to extract pdf files of scientific papers of most popular databases (like PubMed) and analysis they after with artificial intelligence to help researchers to develop science more fast. (because i'm very frustrate with the fact that portals, spaceships and a lot of another cool sci-fiction stuff does not exists yet ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…)

I'm a self-taught programmer and this project is part of personal portifolio that i am building and i will be grateful if you can contribute with feedback of some code change, project structure or something that can made me an better developer! Also, it is an opensource script, that means it's free and you can use it to any thing!

# Why

Currently, if we want to develop a scientific research it's probably we will take a few months or weeks to well fundamented finish it. In most part of time, i believe that we spend reading anothers papers to construct solid base and arguments to our research, however and if we had a tool to extract only the essential of every article? this is what i was thinking when i start this project.
